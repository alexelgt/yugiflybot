*Note: this bot is intended to be used in groups which its main language is Spanish.*

Yu-Gi-Fly Bot is an atrocity created as a joke. The bot sends stickers from [this pack](https://t.me/addstickers/istickerb751e86df2854b72b6109e9949fa2af9_by_istickeri19_bot) whenever it detects an excuse normally used by spoofers (Pokémon GO cheaters) to justify why they spoof.

**The bot does NOT have any kind of configuration.**

## **Content of config.ini**

The file config.ini is missing as it contains the bot's token. Example of the file:

```
[bot]
token = BOT_TOKEN
```

Where BOT_TOKEN is the token given to you by [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
